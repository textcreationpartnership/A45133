    _ Objection 1. This Doctrine will take away the uſe of the Keyes, Excommunicate Excommunication, and leave us no Diſcipline in the Church.

    _ Object. 2. The moſt of men are wholy unfit and not capable of this Ordinance. This is enlarged, Here are things to be done, Preparatory, a ſerious examination; Executory, an exerciſe of Faith, Love, &c. And here are things to be received, Remiſſion, Increase of Grace, Aſſurance, which all cannot obtain neither. Therefore no free Admiſſion hither.

    _ Objection 3. Holy things to holy men.

    _ Object. 4. the Seal is ſet to a Blanck, if All be admitted.

    _ Object. 5. The Covenant belongs not to All, therefore the Seals neither.

    _ Object. 6. The Sacrament is not a converting Ordinance, we preach to all to convert them, but wee may Administer only to the regenerate, to confirm them.

    _ Object. 7. Judas received not the Supper, for in Mat. 26.23.26. he is ſaid to dip his hand in the diſh before the adminiſtration, & in Io. 13.30. as ſoon as he received the Sop he immediately went out. Beſides ſome learned men conceive the Sauce he dipped in, was the Sauce of bitter herbs in the Paſſeover (called Cheroſeth) and that was therefore before the Sacrament.

    _ Object. 8. Vnworthy Receivers are guilty of Chriſts blood, and eat their damnation, therefore wee muſt not allow a free Admiſſion.

    _ Object. 9. The Ordinance is polluted if all be admitted.

    _ Obj. 10. The laſt Objection is from thoſe ſeverall Texts that are alleged for a ſeparation from wicked perſons.
